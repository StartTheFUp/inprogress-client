### A simple but effective project management interface.

Having managed several real-size projects with heavy digital consultant-client communication, education, and task-tracking, we realized that :

1. For clients, Trello is not very accessible, too flexible and hides to much data.
2. Google Docs does not have any good task-tracking ability and after 3 months working on something you'll have to scroll 11 pages
3. Slack and Slite are made for internal digital team communication, not client relationship.

So we decided to think about what would be our ideal project management design...

🎉 Here it is !

> "The young baby of Trello and Google Docs"

  🥞 Real actions are messy and need space. The stacked columns dashboard view will give you plenty.

  ✅ Resources, Tickets and tasks categories only. Focus on what's left.

  🌍 Keep track of complex projects with sub-categories.

  🗣 Discussion is the key. Comment thread are a core part of the interface.

  🚀 Asymmetric design. Perfect for project leaders dealing with non-digital native clients.

  👊 No login needed. Share a single link to your client and you're good to go.

  🍏 Simple. Edit Inplace and selected features. This needs to be usable by your grand mother.
